1.	Hayden, 31, Local Record Label Owner, Google search
He is looking around at new bands to sign to his label. His main focus is on the sound but the visual of the band is a close second.  Having the music readily available on the homepage would allow him to get an instant glimpse of the band’s sound

2.	Ben, 15, High School Kid, Went to a show and grabbed a CD w/website
Looking to find out more about the band. He already has a CD so his main focus isn’t the music but who and what the band are and when they are playing next. Having a well-made tour section and “about me” section will definitely keep him entertained.
